## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of Rails

Bloccit was the first Rails app I ever developed. The purpose of the app was to teach the fundamentals of Rails, and my opinion is that it was very effective. Concepts covered include:

* Basics of ActiveRecord, ActiveModel, ORM, ActionController, and Actionview
* How Rails implements the MVC app structure
* CRUD operations
* Test-Driven Development with Rspec
* Seeding the database with randomly generated data
* Resourceful routing and nested routes
* Authentication, Validation, and Authorization of User Accounts
* User ownership of posts and comments
* Voting for and ranking posts
* Favoriting and unfavoriting posts
* Email notifications for when a favorited post is commented on
* Public User Profiles wich list posts, comments, favorites, and user account status.

It was a lot to take in, and I made some mistakes along the way, but I learned from them and eventually managed to create a fully-functional Rails app that serves as a model for future app development.

# Getting Started
